# Image-to-Text

Optical Character Recognition (OCR): The process of extracting text from images. Tesseract OCR is a popular open-source engine used for this purpose.
Pytesseract: A Python wrapper for Tesseract OCR, allowing you to interact with the engine using Python code.
OpenCV (cv2): A powerful library for computer vision tasks, including image processing and manipulation functions used in this code.
Image Upload: The process of allowing users to provide an image for OCR processing. In GitHub or local environments, this might involve file dialogs or command-line arguments.
Image Path: The location or filename of the image on the user's system.
Grayscale Image: An image containing only shades of gray, often easier for OCR engines to work with.
Extracted Text: The text that is identified and extracted from the image using OCR.
